# kure Music Player

Open-source music player for Android phones and tablets.

It's currently a test project - don't take it too seriously.

Features:

* Music controls
* Shuffle play

## Version support

Since I made this as a test, *kMP* works perfectly on
my phone - Galaxy SIII Mini.
I cannot guarantee it will work on any other.

**kMP** only supports Android versions 4.1.2 and above (API 16).

## Credits

This project was built with a lot of help from the official Android documentation
and a lot of Google searches.
 
Firstly, the whole idea and basis came from [tutsplus]' awesome Android
articles. This project started because of [Sue Smith's][sue] tutorials on
[creating a Music Player on Android][part_one].

When I finished those, new features were added kinda impulsively. A huge
inspiration for project layout organization (and minor tweakings) came
from [k-9 mail] - an open-source mail client for Android. I use it everyday,
thanks a lot guys!

**Iron Maiden** - supporting me through the whole development. Best albums
ever - *Seventh Son of a Seventh Son* and *Powerslave*.
